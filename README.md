## Project objective 
To analyze multi-channel marketing campaign performance using Excel, identify cost-efficient lead sources, and provide data-driven recommendations for budget reallocation to maximize overall lead generation and reduce cost per lead.
## Dataset
<a href="https://github.com/Sandrasunil08/Excel-dashboard/blob/main/marketing_campaign_dataset.csv.zip">marketing_campaign_dataset</a>
## Questions
●	Which channel has the lowest Cost per Lead (CPL)?

●	 Which channels are above the average CPL and need cost optimization?

●	Are we spending in proportion to the leads generated?

●	Which channels have Spend% > Lead% (overspending) and should receive less budget?

●	Which channels have Lead% > Spend% (high ROI) and deserve more budget?

●	Which channel generated the most leads per ₹1000 spend?

●	Which channel contributed the highest % of total leads?

●	Which channel has the highest CTR (Click-Through Rate) — indicating better engagement?

●	Which channel has the lowest CTR, meaning creatives/copy may need improvement?

●	Which channel has the highest Conversion Rate?

●	Are there channels with high CTR but low Conversion Rate, indicating poor targeting?

## Process 
Cleaned the data and created calculated columns (Spend, CPL, Leads per 1000 spend).

Built PivotTables to summarize metrics per channel.

Designed charts: CPL (column), CTR (column), Conversion Rate (bar), Spend vs Leads (pie), Leads/Spend (bar).

Used conditional formatting to highlight inefficient channels.

## Project Insights
•	Website and Email CPL are below average, indicating cost-efficient lead generation.

•	Instagram, Youtube and Google Ads CPL are above average, meaning they are expensive and may require optimization or creative change.

•	Google Ads and Youtube had higher spend share but lower lead share - overspending and lower ROI.

•	Website and emails generated higher % of leads than % of spend - very efficient.

•	Website is the top-performing channel (highest leads per ₹1000 spend).

•	Email and Website has the highest CTR-showing strong ad engagements. 

•	Google Ads has the lowest CTR.

•	Conversion Rate is highest for Emails- not only driving clicks but converting them into leads effectively.

• Facebook has decent CTR but low conversion rate - clicks are coming, but they are not converting.

## Conclusion 
•	This dashboard shows that Website and Email are the most cost-efficient channels for lead generation, contributing more leads per rupee spent.
•	Instagram and Google Ads need performance optimization to reduce CPL and improve conversion rates.
•	Reallocate budget towards high-performing channels (Website & Email) and optimize targeting/creatives for underperforming ones.
